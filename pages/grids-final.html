	<p class="grid-2">(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)</p>


<p class="grid-2">We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well</p>

<p class="grid-2">Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time</p>
